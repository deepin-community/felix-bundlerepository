Information about felix-bundlerepository

from the maven-debian-helper package.

The build system uses Maven but prevents it from downloading
anything from the Internet, making the build compliant with
the Debian policy.


Bootstrapping felix-bundlerepository
------------------------------------
Since libfelix-bundlerepository-java Build-Depends on libmaven-bundle-plugin-java
and libmaven-bundle-plugin-java also Build-Depends on libfelix-bundlerepository-java
we need a way to bootstrap this.

To build felix-bundlerepository without bundle metadata :
1) d/control: Drop Build-Depends on libmaven-bundle-plugin-java
2) d/patches/series: Decomment bootstrap_packaging_jar.diff patch
3) d/maven.ignoreRules: Decomment maven-bundle-plugin dependency
